## Richy Yun, PhD

Hello, I am the **Lead Neuroscientist** at [**Sonera**](https://www.sonera.io/) in Berkeley, CA. 

Sonera is developing highly sensitive but scalable magnetic sensors with large dynamic range to allow for operation in ambient conditions (rather than requiring expensive magnetically shielded rooms). My work has revolved around applications, including testing and verifying sensor capabilities and communicating on improvement points for future designs, comparing magnetic and electrical signals of the body, and applying magnetic sensors for demos leveraging biomagnetism on human subjects. 

Previously, I completed my PhD in Bioengineering in the [Fetz Laboratory](https://depts.washington.edu/fetzweb/) at the University of Washington where I worked with single-unit, local field potential, and behavioral data from non-human primates.

I unfortunately cannot share any of my work at Sonera, so I have used my personal GitHub as a central location both as a backup and to demonstrate my coding capabilities, including some personal projects.

If you would like to learn more about me and my work, please visit my website (currently undergoing updates).

For any questions you can reach me at: richyjyun@gmail.com
