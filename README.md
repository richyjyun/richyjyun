## Richy Yun

Hello, I am a Bioengineering PhD Candidate in the [Fetz Laboratory](https://depts.washington.edu/fetzweb/) at the University of Washington. 

I work with single-unit, local field potential, and behavioral data from non-human primates, obtained from a variety of electrophysiology devices including TDT, g.tec, Ripple, and our in-house [Neurochip3](https://depts.washington.edu/fetzweb/neurochip3.html). During my graduate career I have been particularly interested in electrical stimulation of the cortex, and how to optimized targetted plasticity protocols *in vivo*. Analyses I have done include, but are not limited to, time-series and time frequency analysis, state-space analysis, dimensionality reduction and clustering, and unsupervised learning.

Since most of my work consists of scripting for data analysis, I mainly use GitHub as a central location both as a backup and to demonstrate my coding capabilities rather than for version control in my day-to-day work.
