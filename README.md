### Richy Yun

Hello, I'm a PhD Candidate in the Fetz Laboratory at the University of Washington. 
I work with single-unit and local field potential data from non-human primates, including behavior and overnight studies.
Since most of my work consists of scripting for data analysis, I mainly use Github as a demonstration of my coding capabilities rather than version control.  
If you'd like to learn more about me and my research, please visit my website: richyyun.com
